--- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
---Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.


-- Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

--- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
--- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- 0 First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

-- 2 Then I determined who the Top 5 artists are by popularity

SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5;

--3 Next, I found ouy what is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name,
SUM(danceability)/COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

--4 Then I determined what artist released the longest song and how many minutes was it? 1ms = 0,000016666666666666667 min

SELECT artist_name, duration_ms, duration_ms*0.000016666666666666667 as 'duration_min'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

--5 Then I determined what's the average of danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT AVG(danceability/10)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 6 Then I determined what are the names of the artists that have more than 3 songs as the most popular songs ?

SELECT artist_name,
COUNT(artist_name) as 'No_songs'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(artist_name) > 3;

--7 Then I determined what are the 5 less popular songs and what is their energy punctuation?

SELECT track_name, popularity, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 5;
